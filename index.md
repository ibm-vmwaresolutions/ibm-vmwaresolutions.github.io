- disclosure as always:
  - I am not an author but just trying to share my findings.
  - Comments are welcomed and will do my best to acknowledge them
  - In that same spirit, I welcome being challenged because my goal is to provide accurate and useful content
  - I am a terrible speller
  - I can change and/or update my disclosure at anytime :)
