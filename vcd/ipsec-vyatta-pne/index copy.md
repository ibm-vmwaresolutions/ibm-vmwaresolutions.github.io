## vCD - IPSec Tunnel over IBM Private Network Endpoint (PNE) using Vyatta 

Updated: 2020-12-17

In order to use a PNE for your IPSec tunnel between your IBM account to your IBM VMWare Solutions Shared virtual datacenter (vDC), you must first have a PNE ordered in your vDC.  See how to [Order IBM Private Network Endpoint (PNE)](https://ibm-vmwaresolutions.github.io/vcd/order-pne/).  

Additionally there is a detailed example of connecting two separate virtual datacenters using NSX-to-NSX Edge configuration - [IPSec Tunnel over IBM PNE](https://ibm-vmwaresolutions.github.io/vcd/ipsec-pne/)  

This example will demonstrate how to connect a vCloud Director vDC to another device, Vyatta (NSX-to-Vyatta) in different IBM Cloud account.  This allows bi-directional communication for virtual machines in the virtual datacenter to virtual machines in a different IBM Cloud account fronted by the Vyatta device using the IBM Cloud backbone.  

Details of the Vyatta are listed below.
