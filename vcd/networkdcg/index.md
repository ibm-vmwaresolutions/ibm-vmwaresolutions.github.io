_NOTE:  There are some noticeable differences between vCD v10.1.3 vs v10.2.2.  We will focus on 10.1.3 (current deployed version) and update this document for 10.2.2 as soon as the environment is updated._

A [data center group](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Cloud-Director/10.1/VMware-Cloud-Director-Tenant-Portal-Guide/GUID-086DD0B6-C01C-43EB-BFDE-DED999980B2A.html)
acts as a cross-virtual data center router that provides centralized networking administration, configuration for multiple egress points in multiple virtual data centers, and east-west traffic between all networks within the group. A data center group can contain between one and 16 virtual data centers that are configured to share multiple egress points.

Big picture:  The end result will be to create a network that is owned by an NSX Distributed Logical Router (DLR) creating an iBGP session with two NSX Edge Service Gateways (ESG) therefore allowing VMs that are connected to that network uninterrupted network access if one of the ESG's becomes unavailable.  Ideally this configuration is using ESG's that are in two different physical datacenters.  We will describe how to setup the Cross VDC network in the diagram below:

- 172.16.0.0/24 (Cross VDC network owned by DLR)
- iBGP Session created via the vCD Datacenter Group

## <a name="vcddcgnew"></a>Create New Group
v10.1.3 DCG's are located at `Data Centers` > `Data Center Groups`<br/>
v10.2.2 DCG's are located at `Networking` > `Data Center Groups`<br/>

To [Create a Local Data Center Group](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Cloud-Director/10.1/VMware-Cloud-Director-Tenant-Portal-Guide/GUID-57108C69-3401-451D-88E7-C5AE40629CF7.html), select `Data Centers` > `Data Center Groups` and click on `New Data Center Group`
<kbd><img src="images/1-dcg-new-1.png" style="border: 1px solid black"></kbd>

1-Name:  Enter Name for the DCG, Select `Create Local Group`
<kbd><img src="images/1-dcg-new-2.png" style="border: 1px solid black"></kbd>

2-Network Pool: Select the correct Network Pool (there should only be 1)
<kbd><img src="images/1-dcg-new-3.png" style="border: 1px solid black"></kbd>

3-Data Centers: Select the vDC's to participate in the DGC
<kbd><img src="images/1-dcg-new-4.png" style="border: 1px solid black"></kbd>

4-Review: Check before `Finish`
<kbd><img src="images/1-dcg-new-5.png" style="border: 1px solid black"></kbd>

At this point the Data Center group is created and there is a DLR associated to the group.

## <a name="vcddcgegress"></a>DCG EGress
Prerequisites:<br/> 
_The ESG must have a free interface (vNIC) that will be used to attach to the DLR.  In the case there are no free interfaces on the ESG the Add EGress Point or Add StandBy Egress Point task will fail._

To [Add an Active Egress Point for a Local Data Center Group](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Cloud-Director/10.1/VMware-Cloud-Director-Tenant-Portal-Guide/GUID-2B548862-7F86-4141-B0AA-63564F38B4DF.html), select the `Details` of the DCG
<kbd><img src="images/2-dcg-egress-1.png" style="border: 1px solid black"></kbd>

`Network Topology` > `Add EGress Point`
<kbd><img src="images/2-dcg-egress-2.png" style="border: 1px solid black"></kbd>

Select one of the ESGs from the vDCs that were added.  This will be the current Active EGress point.
<kbd><img src="images/2-dcg-egress-3.png" style="border: 1px solid black"></kbd>

Notice the Active EGress point is now created.  To [Add a Stand-By Egress Point for a Local Data Center Group](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Cloud-Director/10.1/VMware-Cloud-Director-Tenant-Portal-Guide/GUID-2A561E8F-4917-4206-B4AC-373C316CB6C6.html), select the `Network Topology` > `Add Stand By EGress Point` (this requires more that 1 vDC in the DCG)
<kbd><img src="images/2-dcg-egress-4.png" style="border: 1px solid black"></kbd>

Select one of the ESGs from the vDCs that were added.  This will be the current Stand By EGress point.
<kbd><img src="images/2-dcg-egress-5.png" style="border: 1px solid black"></kbd>

Notice the Standby EGress point.  Additionally, if the EGress points need to change roles, a Swap action can be manually initiated via `Swap EGress Points`
<kbd><img src="images/2-dcg-egress-6.png" style="border: 1px solid black"></kbd>

In the ESG settings for the Active and Stand by EGress Points, in the `Routing` > `BGP` section, notice the BGP Configurations have been modified:
- Enable BGP
- Enable Graceful Restart
- Enable Default Originate

A new Neighbor will be created and managed.  If the `Local AS` was previously set to a value other than `65010` it will be overwritten.  The new Neighbor is the Group created via the DLR interfaces to each ESG.  This will be a network `192.168.253.0/30` _This currently CANNOT be changed or the DCG feature will not work as described._  The Active ESG will have a weight of `60` and the Stand-by will have a weight of `30`.

## <a name="vcddcgstretch"></a>DCG Stretch Network
Lastly, to take advantage of the Cross vDC Networking, [Add a Stretched Network](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Cloud-Director/10.1/VMware-Cloud-Director-Tenant-Portal-Guide/GUID-33DEE8AB-D7B7-4214-8B0E-44AE6A1BAF00.html)

`Stretched Networks` > `Add`
<kbd><img src="images/3-dcg-network-1.png" style="border: 1px solid black"></kbd>

Provide `Name` and `CIDR`
<kbd><img src="images/3-dcg-network-2.png" style="border: 1px solid black"></kbd>

New network is now available for BGP across the vDCs of the DCG.
<kbd><img src="images/3-dcg-network-3.png" style="border: 1px solid black"></kbd>

Next would be to put VMs on the Cross-VDC network and build out your use case.
